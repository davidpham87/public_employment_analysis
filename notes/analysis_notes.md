# TODO
- Scale data?
- Make the approriate transformation
- Use the data for supplementary variable

- Compare the models (step, using missing data)
- Quarterly <-> Check dates

# Quarterly 

- No data for population
- Compare amongst countries with only quaterly data

# Missing data

It causes bias.

# Robustness

Robustness?

# Government Fiscal Transparency IMF Data
