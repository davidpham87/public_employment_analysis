\chapter*{Abstract}

Governments employ professional within their mandate to provides public goods
and services. It has been hypothesized that incumbent governments had
incentives to raise the share of civil servants before elections to favor the
odds of reelection. Nevertheless, analysis were performed on annual data and
were not conclusive. This semester paper gathers the data from several sources
(OECD, World Bank) and merge them into one panel data set. Unfortunately, the
signal to noise ratio is modest at best and no definite answer can be provided
by following sound statistical principle.
