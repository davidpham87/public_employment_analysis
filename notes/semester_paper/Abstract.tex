\chapter*{Abstract}

Governments employ professionals within their mandates to provide public goods
and services. It has been hypothesized that incumbent governments have
incentives to raise the share of civil servants before elections to favor their
odds of reelection. Nevertheless, analysis were performed on annual data and
were not conclusive. This semester paper gathers the data from several sources
(OECD, World Bank) with a quarterly frequency and merges them into one panel
data set in order to see any factor influencing the public employment
rate. Unfortunately, statistical analysis of the quarterly data does not show
strong evidence that governments increase the number of public employees before
election.
