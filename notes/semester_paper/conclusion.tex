\chapter{Conclusion}

In this semester paper, part of theory of data completion is reviewed. The main
work is devoted to build a framework to test several R packages for imputation
methods on the FLAS data set. With this data set, it appears that K-nearest
neighbor imputation works fairly well, although its implementation might throw
frustrating low level errors (segmentation faults). Except for
\texttt{softImpute}, all methods have the same order of error (distance between
the imputed and true value). In practice, they could unfortunately not be used
as black-box as most data matrix have collinear dimensions which constitutes an
issue for all the algorithms based on regression.

Finally, as departing words, one should not forget why these technique
exists. From \cite{schafer2002missing},

\begin{quote}
  With or without missing data, the goal of a statistical procedure should be
  to make valid and efficient inferences about a population of interest -- not to
  estimate, predict, or recover missing observations nor to obtain the same
  results that we would have seen with complete data.
\end{quote}
