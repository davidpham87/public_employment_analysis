# Introduction

The purpose of the project is to show if in Switzerland, the unemployment rate
are artificially kept low through public employment, allowed thanks fiscal
transparency (measured by several key indicators).

This hypothesis is backed by the following observations:

* Fiscal opacity allows incumbent government to manipulate official statistics,
  the scale of the gimmickries depends on the level of opacity [@alt2014isn];
* Public employment is mean for incumbent government to redistribute wealth from
  the well-off class to the low-income class [@alesina2000redistributive].
* Public employment is positively correlated with GDP growth in country with low
  fiscal transparency [@aaskoven2015fiscal].
* Switzerland is a country with low fiscal transparency
  [@aaskoven2015fiscal, p.14].
