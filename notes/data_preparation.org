* New variable in the data set

+ GDP per capita (log): GDPVD (PPP, in USD) over population in log. Formula:
  $log(GDPVD/POP)$, where $POP$ is interpolated from annual data (source: OECD).
+ Government revenue (defined as percent of GDP) . Formula: $100\cdot YRG/GDPVD$,
  with $YRG$ interpolated from annual data (why not $YRGT$?).
+ Net lending NLG as % of GDP (interpolated from annual data). Formula:
  $100\cdot NLG/GDPVD$, with $NLG$ interpolated from annual data.
+ GAP (gdp output gap). Formula: $100 \cdot (GDPV/GDPVTR-1)$. Already exist in
  the data base.
+ GAPLFP (deviation from trend of labor force).
+ Inequality SWIID data set: please note that the mean of the imputation is
  considered (and not the 100 imputations from the data set). CAUTION: data
  should be used only up to 2010 as there are no further data for Canada, Japan
  and Ireland (please check the graphics).

* Unclear points

+ I did not compute GDPVDTR (Potential of total economy, at 2010 PPP,
  USD. Formula: $GDPVD/GDPV \cdot GDPDTR$. as I am not sure how we could use
  it. The output gap variable is already in %.
+ Market outcome vs Net outcome: In my notes, I wrote that we should use
  the difference of these two variables but I could not remember where I could
  find the data.

* Data

  The table provides a short description of the most relevant variable for the
  analysis. There are two version, one with all the variable from the oecd
  economic outlook data set and one with only the required variable for the
  regressions.
