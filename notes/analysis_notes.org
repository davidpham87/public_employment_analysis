* Summary


* Model and Data

** Data

Following \cite{aaskoven2015fiscal}, the following variable were selected from
the Economic Outlook database to explain the public employment rate:

| Variable                         | Oecd code   |
|----------------------------------+-------------|
| country                          | country     |
| government employment            | eg          |
| total employment                 | et          |
| GDP growth                       | gdpv_annpct |
| unemployment rate                | unr         |
| government spending              | ypgtq       |
| adult population                 | pop1574     |
| Net household dispossable income | ydrh        |
|----------------------------------+-------------|

Additionally, the following time series were retrieved to compare result of the
regression with \cite{aaskoven2015fiscal} and \cite{alesina2000redistributive}:

| Data                              | Source                         |
|-----------------------------------+--------------------------------|
| GPD per capita                    | OECD \cite{@oecd2015gdp}       |
| gini index                        | OECD \cite{oecd2015inequality} |
| gini index                        | \cite{toth2014chapter}         |
| Fiscal Transparency               | IMF \cite{wang2015trends}      |
| Laassen Fiscal Transparency Score | \cite{aaskoven2015fiscal}      |
|-----------------------------------+--------------------------------|

Unfortunately, these data had an annual frequency only. Note that the IMF
fiscal transparency data provides time series for the last ten years.


** Model

\cite{aaskoven2015fiscal} explains the level of public employment with gdp
growth with an additional nonlinear effect provided by the fiscal transparency
score of a country, namely

\begin{align*}
Y_{i,t} = \alpha + \beta_1 G_{i,t} + \beta_2 G_{i,t} T_i + \beta_3 X_{i,t} + \eta_i + \tau_t + \varepsilon_{i,t},
\end{align*}

where the variables are
+ $Y_{i,t}$, the public employment;
+ $G_{i,t}$, GDP growth;
+ $T_{i}$, fiscal transparency;
+ $X$ is the vector of control variables;
+ $\eta_i$, country fixed effect;
+ $\tau_t$, year fixed effect.

However, with the data from the OECD, the diagnostic plots of this model are
quite disturbing: residuals show a clear correlation and tails of the
distribution clearly deviate from the Gaussian assumption. Moreover, in my
opinion, it is quite controversial to add a nonlinear effect ($\beta_2 G_{it}
T_i$) without looking at the linear effect of $T_i$.

After several attempts to find an acceptable model, the fixed effect with
autoregressive components looked promising. In this model, the difference of
the public employment are explained:

\begin{align*}
\Delta Y_{i,t} = Y_{i,t} - Y{i,t-1}= \alpha + \rho Y_{i, t-1} + \beta_1 G_{it} + \beta_2 X{i, t} + \beta_3 X_{i, t-1} + \tau_t + \varepsilon_{it},
\end{align*}

where the variable are same as previously. Controls variables (in $X_{it}$)were:

- Unemployment rate;
- Log of adult population (aged between 15-74 years old);
- Government expenses;
- Net household disposable income in percent of GDP.

Robustness has been studied by adding and deleting the following variables from the predictors

- Total population;
- GDP per capita;
- Gini coefficient;
- Fiscal transparency scores (IMF time series, Lassen scores and IMF scores).

Result can be found in appendix.

* Challenges with the data

  The data present some challenges: missingness among variable and among frequency.

  As observations are not always present for all variables for a country at a
  fixed year, the common approach in regression analysis is to keep only
  complete-case. This can obviously lead to some bias. In this study, when
  doing robustness analysis, it is possible that the size of the data set vary
  considerably between models.

  Concerning quarterly data, most of control variable are not reported on
  quarterly basis in the oecd dataset \footnote{The dataset in Stata format
  seemed to be corrupted}. A spline smoother has been applied to interpolated
  between points and obviously this affect the quality of the fits with
  quarterly data as the independent variable is too smooth.

** Note about the data

   Fiscal transparency is interacted with gdp growth as it should
   contribute as a good factor. Here are the Lassen Scores as in \cite{aaskoven2015fiscal}

** What remains to be done
   - One has to find data and time series about the political side of the
     government.

* Note

  The original variables were selected because of the prior distribution we had
  on them. Advanced statistical methods should be tried to discover if any other
  predictors could be better. For example, in quarterly data, Lasso method
  selected the variable *Net exports, contribution to growth* as potential
  variable.
